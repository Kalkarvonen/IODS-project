# About the project

**Happy** *to be in the course and am looking forward to learning about how to link my stuff to github as I already have some knowledge learning from machine learning courses and multiomics* *I did not really go too deep into the course book as I have previous experience with R, but it is good that there is a more up to date book for the course although I believe that lot of coding is learned through just googling the problems and more recently by including ai into syntax troubleshooting*
